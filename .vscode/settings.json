    // We haven't installed OpenCV globally, so we need to add the path to the OpenCV
    // DLLs to the PATH environment variable in order for Ctrl+F5 to work with the
    // VS Code CMake extension.
    // Note: If you change the cmake.buildDirectory setting from the default
    //       ${workspaceFolder}/build, you will need to update the path below.
    // THIS HAS BEEN DEPRECTATED in favor of a launch.json configuration! Now use F5,
    //       not Ctrl+F5, to launch the debugger. See launch.json for details. The
    //       benefit is we're robust against change of build folder, and we can step
    //       into OpenCV code!
